//! Mutator: an entity that changes shared locations
//!
//! # Registration
//!
//! In order to track all mutators in one place, we need some form of mutator registration. When a
//! mutator is created, it is registered to a global lock-free singly-linked list of registries; and
//! when a mutator is dropped, it is unregistered from the list.
//!
//! # Pinning
//!
//! Every mutator contains an integer that tells whether the mutator is pinned and if so, what was
//! the global epoch at the time it was pinned. Mutators also hold a pin counter that aids in
//! periodic global epoch advancement.
//!
//! When a mutator is pinned, a `Scope` is returned as a witness that the mutator is pinned.  Scopes
//! are necessary for performing atomic operations, and for freeing/dropping locations.
