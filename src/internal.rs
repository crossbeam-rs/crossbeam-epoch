//! The global data and participant for garbage collection.
//!
//! # Registration
//!
//! In order to track all participants in one place, we need some form of participant
//! registration. When a participant is created, it is registered to a global lock-free
//! singly-linked list of registries; and when a participant is leaving, it is unregistered from the
//! list.
//!
//! # Pinning
//!
//! Every participant contains an integer that tells whether the participant is pinned and if so,
//! what was the global epoch at the time it was pinned. Participants also hold a pin counter that
//! aids in periodic global epoch advancement.
//!
//! When a participant is pinned, a `Scope` is returned as a witness that the participant is pinned.
//! Scopes are necessary for performing atomic operations, and for freeing/dropping locations.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! `Global` is the global data for a garbage collector, and `Local` is a participant of a garbage
//! collector. Use `Global` and `Local` when you want to embed a garbage collector in another
//! systems library, e.g. memory allocator or thread manager.
//!
//! ```
//! use crossbeam_epoch::{Global, Local};
//!
//! let global = Global::new();
//! let local = Local::new(&global);
//! local.pin(&global, |scope| {
//!     scope.flush();
//! });
//! ```
