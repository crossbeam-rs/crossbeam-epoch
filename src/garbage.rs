//! Garbage collection.
//!
//! # Garbages
//!
//! Objects that get unlinked from concurrent data structures must be stashed away until the global
//! epoch sufficiently advances so that they become safe for destruction.  We call these object
//! garbages.  When the global epoch advances sufficiently, `Destroy` garbages are dropped (i.e. the
//! destructors are called), and `Free` garbages are freed.  In addition, you can register arbitrary
//! function to be called later using the `Fn` garbages.
//!
//! # Bags
//!
//! Pointers to such garbages are pushed into thread-local bags, and when it becomes full, the bag
//! is marked with the current global epoch and pushed into a global queue of garbage bags.  We
//! store garbages in thread-local storages for amortizing the synchronization cost of pushing the
//! garbages to a global queue.
//!
//! # Garbage queues
//!
//! Whenever a bag is pushed into a queue, some garbage in the queue is collected and destroyed
//! along the way.  Garbage collection can also be manually triggered by calling `collect()`.  This
//! design reduces contention on data structures.  Ideally each instance of concurrent data
//! structure may have it's own queue that gets fully destroyed as soon as the data structure gets
//! dropped.
